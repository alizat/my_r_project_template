# My R Project Template
My own R Project Template. Feel free to copy and use.

This project template presents a good starting project structure for any new R
project. It is inspired by the [Cookiecutter Data
Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) project
structure. I created this repo to aid me in my data science work at
[Synapse Analytics](https://www.synapse-analytics.io/).

Finally, if there is a different folder that you feel must be added, you may
want to make sure that ***it has no spaces and is all lowercase with underscores!***
