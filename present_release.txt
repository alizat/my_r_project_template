- adjusted model to accommodate change of business paradigm: product-based to granting approved limit
- performed experiments to test how well the ML model would perform under new paradigm
- trained new ML models for deployment in production


** 2022-09-04
- reviewed model to study production model deterioration
- re-trained model using same parameters as before
